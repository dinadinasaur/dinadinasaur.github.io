    <h4 class="typed">Hi, I'm Dina! Welcome to my website!</h4>

    <p>I suppose this website is an online resume or CV of sorts. So here is a look at what I have been up to the past couple of years... </p>

    <h4>Educational background...</h4>
    <p>I recently graduated with and M.S. in Computer Science. I concentrated my studies on the art of software engineering, while also getting to learn about the importance of data and emerging technologies (particularly in the field of Artificial intelligence).</p>
    <p>Prior to my graduate studies in Computer Science, I dedicated my undergraduate career to strengthening my critical thinking skills through the study of Philosophy. I explored ethics and logic, which ultimately guided my decision to transtion to tech.</p>
    <p>The transition from Philosophy to Computer Science was a difficult, though rewarding journey. Along the way, I have found that people are always willing to help. I have had many mentors along the way and am lucky to have a strong support group of women in STEM.</p>

    <h4>Some more fun experiences...</h4>
    <p>
      My career in comedy started when I was 18 years old. I was an intern at a small club on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There a found a mentor who has continued to guide me in this male dominated field.</p> 
      I got to travel to Scotland for the Edinburugh Fringe Festival. There I met comedians from all over the world. After performing stand-up comedy for a few years, I realized that I wanted to shift my focus to working behind the scenes. I contributed to the websites of several comedians including Francis Ellis, Aaron McCann, and Ashley Austin Morris.

      Currently, I am the Social Media Manager for Maddy Smith. I joined her team over a year ago, so I have been able to watch her career growth in real-time.

        Recently, I got to watch her open for Theo Von at the Beacon Theater:
