  <h4>A little bit about me...</h4>
  <p>I recently graduated with and M.S. in Computer Science. I concentrated my studies on the art of software engineering, while also getting to learn about the importance of data and emerging technologies (particularly in the field of Artificial intelligence).</p>
  <p>Prior to my graduate studies in Computer Science, I dedicated my undergraduate career to strengthening my critical thinking skills through the study of Philosophy. I explored ethics and logic, which ultimately guided my decision to transtion to tech.</p>
  <p>The transition from Philosophy to Computer Science was a difficult, though rewarding journey. Along the way, I have found that people are always willing to help. I have had many mentors along the way and am lucky to have a strong support group of women in STEM.</p>
