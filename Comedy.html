<h4>Comedy</h4>
<p>
  My career in comedy started when I was 18 years old. I was an intern at a small club on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. There a found a mentor in the bartender who is now one of the most influential people in the NY comedy scene. 
</p>
<p>
  After my performing stand-up comedy for a few years, I shifted my focus to working behind the scenes. I contributed to the websites of several comedians including Francis Ellis and Ashley Austin Morris.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, I am the Social Media Manager for Maddy Smith. This has been one of the most rewarding experiences up to date. In Maddy, I found a mentor and a friend. I joined her team over a year ago, so I have been able to watch her career growth in real-time.
